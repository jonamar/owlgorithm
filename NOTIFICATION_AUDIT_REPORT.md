# Notification System Audit Report - UPDATED with Test Results

## SOLVED ISSUES âœ…

### 1. **Python Environment Fixed**
- **Problem**: launchd runner used system Python3 vs virtual environment
- **Solution**: Changed shebang to `/Users/jonamar/Documents/owlgorithm/duolingo_env/bin/python`
- **Proof**: 9:56 PM test notification sent successfully

### 2. **Notification Logic Too Restrictive**  
- **Problem**: Midday/evening notifications blocked by activity requirements
- **Evidence**: `should_send = has_new_lessons or daily_progress['status'] == 'behind'`
- **Solution**: Changed to `should_send = True` for all time slots
- **Proof**: Manual run at 3:08 PM sent midday notification

## REMAINING ISSUES TO MONITOR

### 3. **Lesson Count Calculation Discrepancy**
**Current Status**: User reports 6-8 lessons vs system showing 1 lesson
**Analysis**: System counts **core lessons only** (1) vs **total sessions** (5 = 1 core + 4 practice)
**Fresh Data**: June 28: 1 lesson + 4 practice = 5 total sessions

### 1. **launchd Service Execution Issues**
**Location**: `/Users/jonamar/Library/LaunchAgents/com.owlgorithm.duolingo.plist`  
**Evidence**: Service runs `/Users/jonamar/bin/owlgorithm-daily-runner` which calls Python directly

**Problems**:
- Script uses system Python3 (`#!/usr/bin/python3`) instead of virtual environment
- May not have access to installed packages (selenium, requests, etc.)
- No activation of `duolingo_env` virtual environment
- Different Python environment than manual execution

### 2. **Browser Dependencies Failing in launchd Context**
**Location**: `src/scrapers/duome_raw_scraper.py:26-100`

**Problems**:
- launchd runs without user session context
- No access to user's Chrome/Firefox profiles or preferences  
- WebDriver may fail without proper display environment
- Browser security restrictions in daemon context
- ChromeDriverManager downloads may fail without network access

### 3. **File Path and Permission Issues**
**Location**: `/Users/jonamar/bin/owlgorithm-daily-runner:8`

**Problems**:
- Script changes to project directory but may lack write permissions
- Log files written to `logs/tracker.log` may have permission conflicts
- State file `tracker_state.json` may be locked by different user contexts
- JSON file corruption from interrupted writes

### 4. **Environment Variables Missing**
**Location**: launchd execution environment

**Problems**:
- launchd runs with minimal environment (no `$HOME`, `$USER`, `$PATH` extensions)
- Python module paths may not resolve correctly
- Browser binaries not found in limited `$PATH`
- Network proxy settings not inherited from user environment

### 5. **Time-based Notification Logic Too Restrictive**
**Location**: `src/core/daily_tracker.py:117-171`

**Problems**:
- Midday notifications only sent if `has_new_lessons` OR `behind` (line 145)
- Evening notifications only sent if activity detected OR behind goal (line 151)  
- `should_send = False` by default (line 130)
- If scraper fails, `has_new_lessons` is always False, blocking all notifications

### 6. **Network and API Dependencies**
**Location**: `src/notifiers/pushover_notifier.py:87-104`

**Problems**:
- Pushover API calls may fail due to network restrictions in launchd context
- Duome.eu scraping requires outbound HTTPS access
- DNS resolution may fail without proper network configuration
- Silent failures if network timeouts occur

### 7. **Virtual Environment Not Activated**
**Location**: `/Users/jonamar/bin/owlgorithm-daily-runner:1`

**Critical Issue**: The runner script uses system Python3 but the project dependencies are installed in `duolingo_env`. The script needs to either:
- Use the virtual environment Python: `/Users/jonamar/Documents/owlgorithm/duolingo_env/bin/python`
- Or install dependencies system-wide (not recommended)

### 8. **State Management and Concurrent Access**
**Location**: `tracker_state.json`

**Problems**:
- Multiple launchd services might run concurrently (test, debug, main services all loaded)
- File locking conflicts between different service instances
- Race conditions when multiple processes try to update state
- Corrupted JSON from interrupted writes

## **launchd Service Status Analysis**

Current loaded services (all with exit code 0):
- `com.owlgorithm.debug`
- `com.owlgorithm.test645` 
- `com.owlgorithm.duolingo`
- `com.owlgorithm.duolingo.test`

**Issue**: Multiple services running the same script could cause conflicts.

## **Recommended Fix Priority**

1. **Fix Python environment**: Update `/Users/jonamar/bin/owlgorithm-daily-runner` to use virtual environment Python
2. **Consolidate services**: Remove duplicate/test launchd services, keep only main service
3. **Add environment variables**: Include `HOME`, `USER`, `PATH` in plist file
4. **Test browser in launchd context**: Verify Chrome headless works without user session
5. **Add comprehensive logging**: Log all failures to identify specific failure points
6. **Implement fallback notifications**: Send notifications even if scraper fails
7. **Add file locking**: Prevent concurrent execution conflicts
8. **Test notification conditions**: Ensure notifications send under expected scenarios

## **Key Differences from Cron**

- **launchd** runs as user agent vs cron running as system daemon
- **Environment**: launchd has slightly better environment inheritance than cron
- **Logging**: launchd provides better built-in logging to specified paths
- **Dependencies**: Still requires proper Python environment and browser access

The primary issue is likely the virtual environment not being used by the launchd runner script, followed by browser access issues in the daemon context.
