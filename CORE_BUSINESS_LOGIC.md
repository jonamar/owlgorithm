# CORE BUSINESS LOGIC - CRITICAL PROJECT REQUIREMENTS

**‚ö†Ô∏è This document defines immutable business rules that MUST NOT be broken by any code changes. ‚ö†Ô∏è**

## üéØ PROJECT MISSION

Complete 272 French Duolingo units in 548 days (18 months) using data-driven progress tracking.

## üî¢ LESSON COUNTING PRINCIPLE

### **CRITICAL RULE: ALL XP sessions count as lessons**

```python
# ALWAYS TRUE - This logic must NEVER be conditional
is_lesson = True  # Every session that earns XP is a lesson
```

**Why this is immutable:**
- Historical testing: Only counting "¬∑ lesson" sessions missed 68% of learning activity
- ALL session types are legitimate learning: practice, stories, unit reviews, legendary lessons
- Session types are metadata only - they do NOT affect lesson counting

## üéØ DATA SOURCE REQUIREMENTS

### **ONLY Raw Modal Data is Trusted**

```html
<!-- TRUSTED: Only this div contains reliable data -->
<div id="raw" class="hidden fancybox-content">
  <!-- All session history data -->
</div>
```

**Critical requirements:**
- **ONLY** `<div id="raw">` modal data is reliable from duome.eu
- **ALL OTHER** duome.eu data is chronically inaccurate
- **MUST** click "aggiorna" button to refresh or data is stale
- HTTP requests without automation return outdated data

### **Unit Boundary Detection Rules**

```html
<!-- UNIT BOUNDARY (end of unit) -->
<li>...¬∑ <span class="cCCC">legendary / unit review</span></li>

<!-- NOT A BOUNDARY (lesson within unit) -->  
<li>...¬∑ <span class="cCCC">legendary / story /practice</span></li>
```

**Detection rules:**
- **ONLY** "unit review" sessions mark unit boundaries
- "legendary" without "unit review" are regular lessons within a unit
- Count lessons between unit review markers for accurate lessons-per-unit

## üìä DYNAMIC CALCULATION REQUIREMENTS

### **Lessons Per Unit Calculation**

```python
# Use recent unit boundary analysis (most accurate)
lessons_per_unit = analyze_unit_boundaries(recent_sessions)

# NOT static estimates or total_lessons / total_units mixing timeframes
```

**Requirements:**
- Use unit boundary analysis from recent data (unit review markers)
- Recent average: ~19.0 lessons/unit (realistic, not 2.1 from mixed timeframes)
- Update projections as new unit boundaries detected

### **Goal Calculation Chain**

```python
remaining_units = 272 - completed_units
lessons_remaining = remaining_units * recent_lessons_per_unit  
daily_goal = lessons_remaining / days_remaining
```

**Fixed parameters:**
- `TOTAL_UNITS_IN_COURSE = 272`
- `GOAL_DAYS = 548` (18 months)
- `USERNAME = "jonamar"`

## üö® DEVELOPER PROTECTION RULES

### **1. Lesson Counting Protection**

```python
# ‚úÖ CORRECT
for session in sessions:
    if earns_xp:
        lesson_count += 1

# ‚ùå WRONG - Excludes practice/stories
for session in sessions:
    if session_type == 'lesson':
        lesson_count += 1
```

### **2. Data Source Protection**

```python
# ‚úÖ CORRECT - Only raw modal
raw_div = soup.find('div', {'id': 'raw'})
sessions = parse_session_data(raw_div)

# ‚ùå WRONG - Using unreliable page data
stats = soup.find('.stats').text  # Chronically inaccurate
```

### **3. Unit Boundary Protection**

```python
# ‚úÖ CORRECT - Only unit review markers
if "unit review" in session_text.lower():
    is_unit_boundary = True

# ‚ùå WRONG - All legendary sessions
if "legendary" in session_text.lower():
    is_unit_boundary = True  # Includes within-unit legendary
```

## üìà REQUIRED METRICS

**Core tracking:**
- Total lessons: ALL XP sessions counted
- Units completed: Based on unit review boundaries  
- Recent lessons/unit: From unit boundary analysis
- Required daily pace: Dynamic based on remaining effort

**Notification separation:**
- Hardcoded 15 lessons/day goal in notifications (preserved)
- Dynamic calculations for progress reports only

## ‚ö†Ô∏è BREAKING THESE RULES CORRUPTS PROGRESS TRACKING

**Success criteria:**
- No learning activity excluded from counts
- Projections based on trusted data sources only  
- Unit boundaries accurately detected
- Historical data integrity maintained
