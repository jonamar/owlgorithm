### **Analytics Engine**
```python
# New modules to implement
src/analyzers/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ trend_analyzer.py       # Weekly/monthly trend analysis
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ velocity_tracker.py     # Acceleration/deceleration detection
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ goal_optimizer.py       # Dynamic goal recommendations
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ milestone_manager.py    # Achievement tracking
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ prediction_engine.py    # Advanced forecasting
```

### **Notification Enhancements**
- **Weekly reports** - Automatic weekly progress summaries
- **Milestone alerts** - Celebrate achievements
- **Trend notifications** - Alert on significant pattern changes
- **Goal recommendations** - Suggest pace adjustments

## üìä **Features Breakdown**

### **Weekly/Monthly Trend Analysis**
