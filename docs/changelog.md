and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **Notification throttling** to prevent spam when no progress is detected
  - Smart 2.5-hour throttling for notifications when no data changes occur
  - Immediate notifications when progress is detected (lessons/units completed)
  - Persistent timestamp tracking to maintain throttling state across runs
  - Clear user feedback showing throttle status and time remaining

### Changed
- **Notification logic** now respects user engagement patterns
  - Notifications sent immediately when progress is made
  - Throttled to every 2.5 hours during active hours (6am-midnight) when no progress
  - Maintains existing time window behavior (respects configured hours)

### Technical
- Added `last_notification_timestamp` tracking to state data
- Enhanced `send_time_based_notification()` with throttling logic
- Comprehensive unit tests for all throttling scenarios
- Throttling state persists across system restarts
- Configurable throttle duration via `NOTIFICATION_THROTTLE_HOURS`

### Improved
- **Code quality** refactoring for notification throttling
  - Extracted `_should_throttle_notification()` for better separation of concerns
  - Added robust error handling for corrupted timestamps
  - Configurable throttle duration (defaults to 2.5 hours)
  - Optimized datetime.now() calls to reduce redundancy
  - Enhanced test coverage for edge cases (corrupted timestamps, None state data)
  - Better import organization and performance improvements

## [2.3.0] - 2025-07-06

### Added
- **Enhanced notification system** with dynamic progress insights
  - Dynamic required pace calculation (e.g., "10.4 lessons/day" instead of hardcoded 12)
  - Weekly performance averages from actual session data 
  - Projected finish dates with early/late context (e.g., "Aug 09, 2026 (4.9 mo early)")
  - Clean 3-line notification format for quick progress scanning

### Changed
- **Notification format** transformed from static to dynamic insights
  - Before: "Today: 8/12 lessons (67%)\nTotal Sessions: 181\nTime: 19:22"
  - After: "11 / 10.4 lessons (105%)\nweek avg: 10.7 per day\nfinish: Aug 09, 2026 (4.9 mo early)"
- **Single notification system** - removed legacy fallback code for cleaner architecture
- **Test suite updated** to match current intended functionality

### Improved
- **Code quality**: 19% reduction in notification module (70â†’57 lines)
- **Error handling**: Specific exception handling replacing bare except clauses
- **Testability**: Extracted pure formatter function (`_format_notification_message()`) for better unit testing
- **Robustness**: Consolidated duplicate functions and cleaned up imports

### Fixed
- **Weekly average calculation** now properly receives `json_data` parameter in `daily_tracker.py`
- **State reconciliation** in `get_tracked_unit_progress()` handles None state_data gracefully
- **Parameter passing** - eliminated unused parameters and improved function signatures

### Technical
- Consolidated `send_enhanced_notification()` and `send_simple_notification()` into single clean implementation
- Added robust date formatting with `(ValueError, TypeError)` exception handling
- Maintained backward compatibility while eliminating code bloat
- All 26 affected tests updated and passing
