# Notification Redesign Implementation Plan

## Overview
Redesigning notifications to be time-contextual with lesson-focused messaging:
- Morning: Goal setting
- Midday/Evening: Progress updates  
- Night: Daily recap

## Phase 1: Analysis & Planning
- [x] Review current notification system
- [x] Design new notification strategy
- [x] Create implementation plan
- [x] Analyze current code dependencies
- [x] Identify files that need modification

### Files to Modify:
- `src/notifiers/pushover_notifier.py` - Time-based notification templates
- `src/core/daily_tracker.py` - Daily lesson tracking & time detection
- `config/app_config.py` - New config if needed
- State file format updates for daily tracking

## Phase 2: Core Infrastructure Changes

### 2.1 Daily Lesson Tracking
- [x] Add daily lesson counter to state file
- [x] Implement daily reset logic (midnight boundary)
- [x] Add helper functions for daily lesson calculations
- [x] Test daily tracking logic

### 2.2 Time-Based Notification Logic
- [x] Create time-aware notification dispatcher
- [x] Add schedule type detection (morning/midday/evening/night)
- [x] Implement different notification triggers per time slot
- [x] Add priority level logic per schedule

### 2.3 Notification Content Updates
- [x] Create morning notification template (goal setting)
- [x] Create midday notification template (progress check)
- [x] Create evening notification template (final push)
- [x] Create night notification template (daily recap)
- [x] Update notification method signatures

## Phase 3: Integration & Logic

### 3.1 Daily Goal Calculation
- [x] Implement dynamic daily lesson goal calculation
- [x] Add progress percentage calculations
- [x] Create ahead/behind/on-track status detection
- [x] Add trajectory calculations for messaging

### 3.2 Smart Notification Logic
- [x] Morning: Always send goal-setting message
- [x] Midday: Send only if activity detected OR behind
- [x] Evening: Send only if activity detected OR behind goal
- [x] Night: Always send recap
- [x] Implement activity detection logic

### 3.3 Message Content Logic
- [x] Dynamic messaging based on progress status
- [x] Celebration messages for goal achievement
- [x] Motivational messages when behind
- [x] Streak status integration
- [x] Unit completion integration (secondary)

## Phase 4: Testing & Refinement

### 4.1 Unit Testing
- [x] Test daily lesson tracking
- [x] Test time-based logic
- [x] Test notification content generation
- [x] Test edge cases (no activity, over-achievement)

### 4.2 Integration Testing
- [x] Test full workflow with mock data
- [x] Test cron job integration
- [x] Verify state persistence
- [x] Test notification delivery

### 4.3 Refinement
- [x] Adjust messaging tone
- [x] Fine-tune timing triggers
- [x] Optimize notification frequency
- [x] Clean up old code

## Phase 5: Deployment
- [x] Update cron job configuration if needed
- [x] Deploy to production
- [x] Monitor first day of notifications
- [ ] Collect feedback and iterate

## ✅ IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE!

The notification redesign is now fully implemented and ready for production use. 

### What's Working:
- ✅ Time-based notifications (morning/midday/evening/night)
- ✅ Daily lesson tracking with midnight reset
- ✅ Smart notification logic (skip when no activity)
- ✅ Dynamic messaging based on progress status
- ✅ Streak integration from scraper data
- ✅ Celebration/motivational messages
- ✅ Unit completion tracking (secondary metric)
- ✅ Progress percentage calculations
- ✅ All notification templates implemented

### Ready for Production:
The system is running on the existing 4-times-daily cron schedule and will provide contextual, time-appropriate notifications that focus on daily lesson goals while maintaining trajectory awareness.

## Implementation Notes
- Keep it simple - don't over-engineer
- Focus on lessons as primary metric
- Units are secondary for trajectory only
- Commit at each major phase completion
- Ask for help if stuck

## Commit Strategy
