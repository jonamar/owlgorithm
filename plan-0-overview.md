- âœ… **Clear success criteria**: "X/12 lessons today"
- âœ… **3 files changed**, focused approach

### `plan-future-enhancements.md` - **IMPLEMENT AFTER**
- ðŸ”® **4 major epics** for comprehensive improvements
- ðŸ”® **11-15 days** of development work
- ðŸ”® **Advanced features**: goal tracking, burn rate analysis
- ðŸ”® **Requires stable foundation** from urgent fix first

## ðŸŽ¯ Recommended Approach

   - Verify automation stability
   
2. **Week 2+**: Begin `plan-future-enhancements.md`
